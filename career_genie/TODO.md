## Notes

- In production, `NODE_ENV=production` and `JWT_SECRET` must be defined.
- Dev-only fallback auth is gated by `ALLOW_DEV_AUTH=1`.
- `server/mock-server.js` now sets hardening headers and requires a strong secret when deployed.

## Update process

- Whenever any task is completed, move it from the `Remaining` section to the `Completed` section.
- When a project change is made, add a corresponding entry to `docs/WORKFLOW_LOG.md` with the date and a short description.
- Keep this file and `docs/WORKFLOW_LOG.md` in sync: every completed task must be reflected in both places.
- If a new task is added, append it to the `Remaining` section and mention it in the workflow log.
